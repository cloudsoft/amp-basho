4. Requirements of Licensee. Licensee may provide feedback regarding the Product including without limitation any functionality issues, and errors, flaws, failures, or faults in the Product (collectively, "Feedback") via an online Cloudsoft forum or other method. Licensee hereby grants to Cloudsoft a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free, fully-paid, right and license to use and exploit in any manner and for any purpose all Feedback and related information.

5. Confidential Information. The Product and Materials contain Confidential Information and trade secrets of Cloudsoft and its licensors. "Confidential Information" means all software code and information furnished by Cloudsoft in oral, written or machine-readable form, disclosed as a result of this Agreement, and that should reasonably have been understood by Licensee, because of legends or other markings, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information itself, to be proprietary and confidential to Cloudsoft, a Cloudsoft affiliate or other third party. Licensee will use the same standard of care to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of the Confidential Information that Licensee uses to prevent the disclosure of its own similar confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. Licensee will disclose the Confidential Information only to its employees with a need to know for the purposes of this Agreement. The restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information that becomes publicly known through no fault of the Licensee or its personnel. All obligations regarding Confidential Information received prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

7. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL CLOUDSOFT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM BASED UPON A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE; OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MALFUNCTIONS, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY PROFITS, EVEN IF CLOUDSOFT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 7 REPRESENT THE AGREED AND BARGAINED FOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES, AND THE COMPENSATION OF CLOUDSOFT FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER REFLECTS SUCH ALLOCATIONS. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS ARE AN ALLOCATION OF THE RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon written notice to the other party. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Licensee will use reasonable efforts to deinstall and destroy the Product or return the Product and Materials to Cloudsoft.

10. General. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, notwithstanding any different or additional terms that may be contained in the form of purchase order or other document used by Licensee to place orders or otherwise effect transactions hereunder, which such terms are hereby rejected. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals and agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, provided that if Licensee has entered into or later enters into another valid agreement with Cloudsoft regarding the Product (whether or not such other valid agreement was physically executed by Licensee, including without limitation any "click-through" agreement or any applicable terms and conditions posted on any Cloudsoft website), then such other agreement shall supersede this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California without reference to its conflict of laws principles. All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Francisco, California, and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue.
